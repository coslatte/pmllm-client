# Client Web Overview: Interface for Music Recommendation System with RAG

This repository contains the web client (pmllm-client) developed with Next.js 16, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It is a graphical interface that acts as a mediator between the user and the backend processing, providing an intuitive experience to interact with a Knowledge-Graph + Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system based on Gemma 3.

## Purpose from the User's Perspective

- **Interactive Chatbot**: A classic chat interface where users send prompts (messages) and receive responses generated by the LLM (Gemma 3) from the backend. Responses include contextual explanations, source citations, and confidence scores.
- **Music Recommendation System**: A dedicated UI section for obtaining personalized recommendations of courses, musical pieces, playlists, and music-related resources, based on the knowledge graph and information retrieval from the backend.
- **Relationship Discovery**: Visualization of connections between musical topics (genres, artists, theoretical concepts) through the interface, leveraging the backend's knowledge graph.

## Architecture from the Client's View

The web client connects via REST API to the backend, which handles:

1. **Processing Backend**:
   - Knowledge Graph (KG) with MusicBrainz data (artists, recordings, genres, etc.)
   - Vector Store (Milvus) for embedding retrieval
   - Generation with Gemma 3 for high-quality responses
   - Orchestration of queries and recommendations

2. **Client Interface**:
   - **Chat Interface**: Sending prompts to the backend and displaying responses with rich formatting (citations, confidence)
   - **Recommendations UI**: Panels to explore music recommendations, with filters and navigation by relationships
   - **User Experience**: Responsive design with **Tailwind CSS v4 exclusively** (no custom CSS), optimized for students, educators, and music professionals

3. **API Endpoints Used**:
   - `/recommend`: For obtaining personalized music recommendations
   - `/connect`: For exploring relationships in the knowledge graph
   - `/ask`: For general queries via chatbot

## Complete System Context

The backend implements a RAG + KG system that uses Gemma 3 (e.g., `google/gemma-3-1b`) for generation, without fine-tuning. It employs embeddings and vector stores for retrieval, with Neo4j for the knowledge graph derived from MusicBrainz. The web client is the presentation layer that makes this advanced functionality accessible through a user-friendly interface.

## Key Client Functionalities

- **Chat with the LLM**: Conversation interface for questions about music, theory, recommendations, etc.
- **Interactive Recommendations**: Exploration of courses, similar artists, preference-based playlists
- **Relationship Visualization**: Charts or lists showing connections (e.g., "harmony → counterpoint → orchestration")
- **Session Management**: History of chats and personalized recommendations

This client transforms the backend's power into an accessible tool for music education, professional practice, and music discovery.
